  <h2>Best Homemade Bolognese Sauce Recipe</h2>
  <p>Bolognese sauce, or ragù alla bolognese, is a rich and flavorful meat sauce originating from Bologna, Italy. It's characterized by its slow-cooked mixture of ground meat, typically a blend of beef and pork, simmered in a flavorful sauce made with milk, cream, and a combination of vegetables like carrots, celery, and onions. This long cooking process allows the flavors to meld together, resulting in a deeply satisfying sauce that's perfect for pairing with pasta like tagliatelle or lasagna.</p>
